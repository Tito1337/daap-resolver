This is a Python resolver for Playdar/Tomahawk music players.

Tested with Python 2.7.2 and a mt-daap server. Not sure it will work 
with an Apple iTunes server.

All depedencies included (or at least I hope so)

This is my first resolver for Playdar/Tomahawk, feedback very welcomed!

INSTALLATION
============
1. Uncompress where you like
2. Modify the DAAP_HOST value in daap-resolver.py to match your DAAP 
server's address
3. Add daap-resolver.py in your resolvers
