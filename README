This is a Python resolver for Playdar/Tomahawk music players. Uncompress 
it somewhere then add "daap-resolver.py" as new resolver.

Tested with Python 2.7.2 and a mt-daap server. Not sure it will work 
with an Apple iTunes server.

All depedencies included (or at least I hope so)

This is my first resolver for Playdar/Tomahawk, feedback very welcomed!
